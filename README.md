# App47 iOS PhoneGap example

## Installation

This is a sample PhoneGap project for iOS; consequently, you can clone this repo and open it in XCode. This App makes use of the App47 SDK (via the [App47 PhoneGap plugin](https://github.com/App47/phonegap-plugins)) for mobile analytics including sessions, timed events, generic events, and logging. What's more, this project uses App configurations, which allow for runtime updates of desired variables, etc. 

You will still need to set up the [App47 SDK in your XCode project](http://app47.com/wiki/doku.php?id=configure:iosapp); be sure to also specify either `*` or `api.app47.mobi` as an allowed host (via the `ExternalHosts` key) in the PhoneGap.plist file. 

Files to pay attention to:

* `AppDelegate.m` -- the App47 Agent is initialized: `[EmbeddedAgent configureAgent];`
* `gravy.js` -- included via `index.html` and is where App47 PhoneGap plug is utilized
